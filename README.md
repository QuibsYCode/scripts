# Scripts
Some scripts I've created for use at work. For problems that no one else had but, probably.

## Umbrella Domain Check
This script can be used to generate your API token and fetch the results of requests, allows, and blocks for the last 30 days across your organizations. I wanted to have a quick way to resolve DNS checking when vendors provide a list of URLs to whitelist, or quickly check the status of a domain. More work can be done on this in the future, such as adding categorization for the domains or determining the allow/blocklist that it is on (if any).
